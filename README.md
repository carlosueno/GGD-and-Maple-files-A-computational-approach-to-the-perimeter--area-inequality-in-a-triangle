# GGD-and-Maple-files-A-computational-approach-to-the-perimeter--area-inequality-in-a-triangle

In this repository we include the following files:

1) A Maple .mw file containing computations used in the article "A computational approach to the perimeter-area inequality in a triangle" (in case you do not have the Maple software, to see this file you can download the Maple Player from https://maplesoft.com/products/maple/Mapleplayer/ )
2) A PDF output of the previous file.
3) A GeoGebra .ggb file containing the basic construction mentioned in the article, showing the geometric locus under study.
